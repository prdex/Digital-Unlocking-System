# Digital-Unlocking-System

Digital Locking System is a locking system which  can be unlocked using fingerprint of the user. One more way to 
unlock it is using an Android Application installed in the user’s smartphone. User needs to connect the smartphone via bluetooth
to the bluetooth module of the system. The security of the lock is major concern. For it, the system is backed-up by an OTPverification
system which verifies the user’s phone number by sending an SMS containing the OTP sent by the system. It is
verified by the system as the OTP received will be entered by the user in the application. Only the genuine user will be allowed
to register in the database. Once registered, the user will only
need to login using his mobile number and password and can
unlock the lock.
